# MechaDigit-1
Info and code samples for my Knex 8-bit mechanical computer, MechaDigit-1, which is still in progress.

This is a mechanical computer design that uses mostly custom components that I've invented, and I started building the first prototype out of Knex in early 2024. The designs can be built out of other materials, I just decided on Knex since I already have a lot and didn't need to buy much more. It was inspired by Ben Eater's SAP-1 videos and the desire to make a huge mechanical contraption, even larger than my previous robot project.

The purpose of this project is to make a model for education on how computers work at the bit level, and it also makes a great disaplay piece, for example as a museum exhibit. The speeds are incredibly slow and there is no screen, but every operation, control line, and memory bit can be seen (and heard!) as it moves at speeds that a human can detect.

When it's done there will be a display that converts the internal binary values into decimal and will be able to run simple programs.
